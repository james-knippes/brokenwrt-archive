This is BrokenWrt. An intentionally vulnerable router Firmware for
practical network attacks. It is designed to run on the Fritz!Box 4040
with an additional USB storage and USB wi-fi interface attached.

The buil procedure is close to the one of OpenWrt with some additional
in between. Some manual configuration is also required at the moment.
This limitation will hopefully be removed in a later revision and all
steps included into the buildsystem or additional scripts.

This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

To build your own firmware you need a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack
of a case sensitive file system.

You need gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make, find, grep, diff,
unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers installed.

1. Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to obtain all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks for all obtained
packages into package/feeds/

3. Clone the BrokenWrt-Environment git into the 'env' folder and create symlinks
from 'files' to 'env/files' and from '.config' to 'env/.config'

4. Use "./scripts/env switch f4040_bwrt001" to change to the appropriate environment config.

5. Run "make" to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build
the cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the Linux kernel & all
chosen applications for your target system.

6. Flash the firmware onto the device

7. Repeat steps 4.-5. for the 'f4040_bwrt001c' and 'f4040_bwrt001e' environment configs.

8. Extract the the two rootfs images from 7. onto a ext4 formatted usb drive into the
   folders 'cont/f4040_bwrt001c' and 'cont/f4040_bwrt001e' respectively

9. Apply 'chown -R 65536:65536' to the root of the usb drive.

10. Start the router with usb drive inserted and change the '/etc/config/fstab' file to
    reflect the UUID of the ext4 partition on the usb drive.

11. Optionally change the path to the usb wifi interface
    in '/srv/lxc/f4040_bwrt001c_00/config' if necessary
